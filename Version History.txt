Version 2.0
Last edited date: April. 5, 2020
Description: This is the second update to this program. Edits include removing the need for third party modules such as dirsync and colorama. The program now does not need any third party modules to run. Removal of the printing of the word Transpire in a large style was removed in order to increase efficiency. Removed the auto installer for missing modules because no third party modules are needed, as all modules used should come pre built in python. Plus the removal of a few minor bugs that caused the program to act unexpectedly. 

Changes: Removed need for third party modules, removed large Transpire word display for efficiency, and corrected minor bugs. 

Bugs fixed: Fixed two invalid function calls that sometimes caused the program to glitch and cause GUI to freeze.

Changes: Changed the images displayed by the program for the GUI, added a icon, and fixed a few bugs. There were many bug fixes, none of which were major. All bugs fixed pertained to the GUI display of Transpire. I also rearranged pieces of code to improve the speed of the program while removing and simplifying code for speed.
